# Salt'n Pepper Website

This project is an **HTML** and **CSS** based website created as part of the **SMIT Saylani Mass IT Training Program** assignment. The purpose of this project was to practice fundamental web development skills and deliver a simple, functional website as per the assignment requirements.

## Overview
The **Salt'n Pepper Website** is a basic static website designed to showcase a restaurant's features, including its menu, services, and contact information. Although it is not responsive, it adheres to the principles of clean design and structured coding, making it suitable for beginner-level practice and assignment completion.

## Features
- Built using **HTML** and **CSS**.
- Includes essential sections for a restaurant website, such as:
  - **Home**
  - **Menu**
  - **About Us**
  - **Contact Us**
- Organized and clean code structure.
- Designed with simplicity to meet the assignment requirements.

## Limitations
- The website is **not responsive** and may not display optimally on devices with different screen sizes.
- Advanced interactivity and animations are not implemented, as the project focuses on basic HTML and CSS skills.

## Learning Objectives
Through this project, I practiced:
1. Structuring a webpage using **HTML**.
2. Styling elements using **CSS**.
3. Creating layouts and basic designs for a website.

## Future Improvements

3. Refine the design for a more professional look.
